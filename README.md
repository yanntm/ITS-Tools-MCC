# ITS-Tools packaged for the Model-Checking Contest

 This project contains :
* support for downloading and deploying ITS-tools. Simply run : ./install_all.sh
* wrapper scripts used in the contest, in particular `BenchKit_head.sh` that supports invocation of its-tools from the command line for PNMCC style queries


## Model Checking Contest Awards

### In 2021


This tool  won the following awards at the [Model-Checking Contest 2021 edition](https://mcc.lip6.fr/2021/) :

 * Reachability, UpperBounds, GlobalProperties gold :  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/gold-Reachability-2021.png" alt="Gold Reachability" width="50px" height="50px">  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/gold-UpperBounds-2021.png" alt="Gold Upper bounds" width="50px" height="50px">  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/gold-GlobalProperties-2021.png" alt="Gold Global Properties" width="50px" height="50px"> 
 * CTL, LTL silver :  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/silver-CTL-2021.png" alt="silver CTL" width="50px" height="50px">  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/silver-LTL-2021.png" alt="silver LTL" width="50px" height="50px">
  * StateSpace bronze :  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2021/bronze-StateSpace-2021.png" alt="Bronze StateSpace" width="50px" height="50px">

It thus was on the podium of *all* categories of the contest, and outright won half of them.

### In 2020

This tool  won the following awards at the [Model-Checking Contest 2020 edition](https://mcc.lip6.fr/2020/) :

 * Reachability gold : <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2020/gold-Reachability-2020.png" alt="Gold Reachability" width="50px" height="50px">
 * CTL, LTL, StateSpace bronze :  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2020/bronze-CTL-2020.png" alt="Bronze CTL" width="50px" height="50px">  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2020/bronze-LTL-2020.png" alt="Bronze LTL" width="50px" height="50px">  <img src="http://mcc.lip6.fr/certificates/2020/bronze-StateSpace-2020.png" alt="Bronze StateSpace" width="50px" height="50px">

It also got the second place (silver ?) in the [Deadlock Detection](https://mcc.lip6.fr/2020/index.php?CONTENT=results/ReachabilityDeadlock.html&TITLE=Results%20for%20ReachabilityDeadlock) category, though in 2020 this category was merged into "GlobalProperties" (for the first time) so there is no related medal.

In pure symbolic and structural reduction mode it also participated in conjunction with Lola, as the tool ITS-Lola and won several awards. 
ITS-lola project lives here https://github.com/yanntm/its-lola.

### Previous years

The tool gathered many medals in the MCC and has been participating since the first edition. 
The 2020 submission is however a major landmark with new strategies described in the paper "Structural Reductions Revisited" published at PetriNets 2020.

See the contest pages for more details on the awards won for previous years.

## Usage

As this tool conforms to the Model-Checking contest rules, please see the [MCC instructions](https://mcc.lip6.fr/pdf/MCC2020-SubmissionManual.pdf) to see how these `BenchKit_head.sh` scripts are meant to be invoked, and what is expected outputs from the tool in terms of verdict reporting.

To install, simply clone this repository and run `install_all.sh` script. This build is Linux specific as these are the conditions in the contest.

To analyze a model you need : a `model.pnml` Petri net and an `Examination.xml` property file in the current working directory.

Then define the environment variables `BK EXAMINATION` (to one of `ReachabilityDeadlock,UpperBounds,ReachabilityCardinality,ReachabilityFireability,LTLFireability,LTLCardinality,CTLFireability,CTLCardinality`) and `BK TIME CONFINEMENT` (in seconds).

If you are not running in the default MCC path `/home/mcc/BenchKit`, also define `BK_BIN_PATH` to the installation folder where you ran `./install_all.sh`.

Finally invoke `BenchKit_head.sh` script.

# Testing

This tool being compliant to MCC can be tested using our MCC testing framework https://github.com/yanntm/pnmcc-tests :

Set it up like this :
```
git clone https://github.com/yanntm/ITS-Tools-MCC.git
cd ITS-Tools-MCC
./install_all.sh
git clone https://github.com/yanntm/pnmcc-tests.git
cp -r pnmcc-tests/* .
./install_oracle.sh
```

Then for any test in `oracle/` you can run :
```
./run_test.pl oracle/Angiogenesis-PT-05-LTLF.out
``` 

To ensure the build is reproducible there is a Github Actions attached to this repository that runs this exact test, see https://github.com/yanntm/ITS-Tools-MCC/actions for some logs of it running.

# Additional Flags

You can pass extra flags when invoking BenchKit_head.sh that will affect the behavior of the tool. 

* -rebuildPNML : at the end of the reduction phase, output a reduced model and property.

Depending on the examination lots of different things happen. 

You can modify the flags that are presently passed to `runeclipse.sh` in the `BenchKit_head.sh` script :

Solution engines :
* -its responds to all examination, and uses hierarchical set decision diagrams as solution engine 
* -smt only supports ReachabilityXX, and uses a BMC/Induction approach reliant on Z3 
* -ltsmin supports Reachability and LTL and uses LTSmin  https://ltsmin.utwente.nl/ as solution engine

Additional flags :
* -greatspnpath $BINDIR/greatspn/ -order META : these flags make the -its engine use the variable ordering suggested by GreatSPN's heuristics. See https://github.com/greatspn/SOURCES for more values of the -order flags you could use.
* -manyOrder divide the available time in slices to try several different variable orderings

Solution engines, activate as many as you wish, they run in portfolio : -its -smt -ltsmin -onlyGal

* -its : Generates examination.gal and examination.prop/ctl/ltl, then calls ITS-tools + interprets results.

* -smt : Generate a pair of SMT solvers running BMC/KInduction for ReachabilityXXX properties.

* -ltsmin 
Generate model.c/.h + compilation to gal.so + run ltsmin + interpret results

For finer control :

* -disablePOR
Partial Order Reduction is only available with ltsmin target. 
But computing the POR matrices can be costly, so this flag disables that.
In combination with onlyGAL quickly maps pnml to .c/.h (+ gal.so if -ltsmin is set).
In combination with -ltsmin, disables computation of NES/NDS/COENABLED/DNA matrices and removes flags that activate POR from ltsmin invocations.

Mostly for debug, and for further reuse of the GAL target : 
* -onlyGal
Builds Examination.gal/Examination.prop (like -its but without running its-reach).
Builds model.c/model.h (like -ltsmin) but does not run ltsmin.
If ltsmin is set, also generates gal.so (we can't compile without ltsmin headers) but still does not run ltsmin.

More options are under development to leverage other existing transformations to GAL, please ask <mailto:yann.thierry-mieg@lip6.fr> if you
 need a command-line tool that processes some of the other languages we support with ITS-tools (e.g. Uppaaal xta, Tina tpn, Divine DVE, Spin promela...).
